WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PATCH FILES, MINIFIED JAVASCRIPT, AND ALL FILES NORMALLY FOUND IN AN UNMODIFIED MINECRAFT RESOURCE PACK, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SHARE, DISTRIBUTE, OR REPURPOSE ANY FILE USED BY OR PRODUCED BY THE SOFTWARE IN THIS REPOSITORY WITHOUT PRIOR PERMISSION FROM THE PROJECT AUTHOR.

NOT FOR COMMERCIAL OR MALICIOUS USE

Prohibited sharing, distribution, and repurposing these files includes but is not limited to: Publicly sharing or distributing any significant portion, modified or unmodified, of any source code files produced by the buildtools commands without minification or obfuscation, with the exception of patch files. Publicly repurposing, without permission, the source code for any file which is a part of the Eaglercraft runtime, as in any additional source files required for output of buildtools commands to run on a specific platform. Publicly repurposing, without permission, any resource file found in the project's default resource pack that does not exist in vanilla Minecraft resource packs. And, additionally, publicly repurposing, without permission, any data produced by the act of compiling or converting the files described in these previous three cases, besides the compiled or minified application (the 'game') itself.

Prohibited commercial use includes selling access to any files or data (including the game itself) contained or produced by this repository, requiring the direct forced viewing of advertisement presented when a user attempts to load a compiled version of this project (or follow a hyperlink to the project's source or files derived from it, examples include using adfoc.us or adf.ly on your site), and selling content in any form that can only be accessed through the use of this project or files produced by or derived from it. Making a pay-to-win multiplayer server, for example, would be prohibited under these terms.

Malicious use includes creating and/or distributing modified versions of the game's 1.8 client (often referred to as "hacked clients") which give you an unfair advantage on multiplayer servers, creating and/or distributing modified clients which allow you to exploit bugs in EaglercraftXBungee or Eagler-compatible server software, creating and/or distributing modified clients which allow you to exploit bugs in Minecraft servers or Minecraft-compatible server software, or creating and/or distributing modified clients which allow you to exploit bugs in portions of any other software used in companion with EaglerXBungee or on an Eagler-compatible server (e.g. VIAaaS, NGINX, Caddy)

Distribution of any file or a product of compilation or conversion covered by this document must retain all existing copyright notices found within the file and folders before any modifications were made.
